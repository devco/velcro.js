    <h2>Views <small>Functional UI separation.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Views allow you to separate your application into smaller chunks of display logic. A single view instance is set up to render multiple views using the same conventions. The router uses a view instance to render views into its bound container. The <code>include</code> and <code>extend</code> bindings use view instances to transform the elements.</p>

<p>To setup a view instance, simply create a new <code>velcro.View</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var view = new velcro.View(options);</code></pre>

<p>A view instance can be passed the following options:</p>

<div data-vc-include="path: 'widgets/tables/options', context: {
    options: [{
        name: 'idPrefix',
        value: '&quot;vc-view-&quot;',
        description: 'The id prefix to use when searching for a view in the DOM by its id.'
    }, {
        name: 'idSuffix',
        value: '&quot;&quot;',
        description: 'The id suffix to use when searching for a view in the DOM by its id.'
    }, {
        name: 'idSeparator',
        value: '&quot;-&quot;',
        description: 'The separator to replace all invalid id characters with when searching for a view in the DOM by its id.'
    }, {
        name: 'target',
        value: false,
        description: 'The element container in which to render the view content to. All content will be replaced.'
    }, {
        name: 'http',
        value: '{'
        + '\n    prefix: \'views/\','
        + '\n    suffix: \'.html\','
        + '\n    headers: {'
        + '\n        Accept: \'text/html\''
        + '\n    }'
        + '\n}',
        description: 'A <code>velcro.Http</code> instance or options to pass to an instance.'
    }]
}"></div>

<p>To render a view, you simply call <code>render()</code> and pass it a path to the view you want to render.</p>
<pre><code>view.render('path/to/my/view', callbackWhenDone);</code></pre>

<p>The path you specify is formatted to a valid id for local searching. For example, the previous path would become <code>vc-view-path-to-my-view</code>. This is because it replaces all invalid id characters with the <code>idSeparator</code>, prepends the <code>idPrefix</code> and appends the <code>idSuffix</code>.</p>

<p>The instance will then attempt locate the view in one of three ways one of <em>three</em> ways:</p>
<ol>
    <li>It first checks its cache for a view using the id formatted from the specified path.</li>
    <li>It will then check the DOM for a view using the id formatted from the specified path.</li>
    <li>Lastly, it attempts to load the view using the configured <code>http</code> instance using the specified path.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the instances makes it to step three, it uses the original path you specified - in this case <code>path/to/my/view</code> - and calls <code>http.get('path/to/my/view')</code> in an attempt to locate an external view. The <code>velcro.Http</code> instance then massages that depending on how it is configured and returns the content if it is found. If a view is found, its contents is cached using the formatted id for reuse.</p>

<h3>Optimisation</h3>

<p>Some may frown at incurring network overhead simply to get a view even if it is cached after its first load attempt. This is where step 2 comes in. It is fairly trivial to compile all of your views into a single file, however, if that is not your cup of tea, you can define your views inside of your main file using <code>script</code> tags.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script id="vc-view-path-to-my-view" type="text/html"&gt;
    &lt;h1 data-vc-text="text: title"&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;div data-vc-html="html: content"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, all we had to do was give it an id that will match a formatted path and give it the type of <code>text/html</code>. You can either do this manually or compile all of your views into one. A Grunt task for this will be covered further in the <a href="#documentation/optimisation">Optimisation</a> section.</p>
